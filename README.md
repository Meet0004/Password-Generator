# Random Password Generator

This is a simple JavaScript-based Random Password Generator that allows users to generate a secure password and copy it to the clipboard with ease.  
## Features -

2. Ensures at least one character from each category (uppercase, lowercase, number, and symbol) for better security.  
3. Allows users to copy the generated password to the clipboard with a single click.
4. Uses the Clipboard API for smooth copying (fallback provided for older browsers).

2. The password appears in the input field.  
3. Click the "Copy Password" button to copy it to the clipboard.  
4. If no password is generated, an alert prompts the user to create one first.
